Our project is composed of Yelp and Covid-19 data we gathered directly from Yelp and Kaggle.
The goal of our project is to graphically display places where you can acquire food in North Carolina, according to Yelp.
We’re going to use chart.js as our javascript library that we didn’t cover in class to make some of the charts to display the data.
